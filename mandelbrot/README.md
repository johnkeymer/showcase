# Mandelbrot Browser
The Mandelbrot Browser is a very simple tkinter browser for the mandelbrot set. The vast majority of the code is for the setting up of the GUI - the actual generation of the set is quite basic and small.

## Usage

```bash
python3 mbrot.py
```
Use the mouse to draw a square region to zoom in on a particular area (hint - pick areas with a lot of change as they tend to be most interesting!). Click Save to save an image of the current screen to the current directory (example below).

## Example
Output image.
