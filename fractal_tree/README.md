# Fractal Trees
This is another small piece of code I created whilst teaching myself Python. It generates a tree image with random variations using recursion. Click the image to generate a new tree.

## Installation
You will need to have pygame installed to run this. If you are using pip:
```bash
pip3 install pygame
```

## Usage

```bash
python3 fractal_tree.py
```
Click anywhere in the window to generate a new tree. 

## Example
Output image.
![output](./output.png?raw=true)
